<h1>Best films according to Beth</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Fifth Element</h3>
<p>The visuals, the costumes, the music, all combining together to make a work of art.</p>

<h3>The Proposal</h3>
<p>My 'pick-me-up' film when I'm sad. This never fails to make me laugh outloud.</p>

<h3>Maleficent</h3>
<p>This film is beautiful in a way that I find completely compelling. Some great acting (apart from that fake British accent, Angelina).</p>
